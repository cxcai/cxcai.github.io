I am an assistant professor of [https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/ Industrial and Operations Engineering] and an affiliate faculty member of [https://ece.engin.umich.edu/ Electrical and Computer
Engineering] at [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan]. \n

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pennsylvania, advised by [http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/  T.~Tony Cai] and [http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/ Hongzhe Li]. I obtained my Ph.D.~in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University in 2021, advised by [http://yuxinchen2020.github.io Yuxin Chen] and [https://ee.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor H.~Vincent Poor]. I have also worked with Sergio Verd√∫ at Princeton. Prior to this, I received my B.E.~in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2016. \n

#I am broadly interested in theories and algorithms for mathematical data science, high-dimensional statistics, optimization and machine learning. More specifically, I develop algorithms to extract information from high-dimensional and structured data, and design methods for optimal data-driven decision-making. The central goal is to achieve provably optimal statistical guarantees and computational efficiency. 

I am broadly interested in mathematical data science, with a recent focus on diffusion model, reinforcement learning, high-dimensional statistics, and nonconvex optimization.
